# Prototype-selection-for-nearest-neighbor
A way to speed up nearest neighbor classification is to replace the training set by a carefully chosen subset of “prototypes”. A good strategy for choosing prototypes from the training set, bearing in mind that the ultimate goal is good classification performance, is implemented here


Assuming that 1-NN will be used, the following algorithm can be implemented.

Algorithm has been tested on the MNIST dataset, available at:
